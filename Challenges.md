# Challenges in hand: 

## Q. How will I validate that email id is the college email id?
    - Abstract API can be a good solution to this but i don't know anything about that so lets try at the time of backend implementation and see what happen.
## Q.  How to verify email using otp:
    - We can use a third party service like Nexmo or Twilio to send OTP to the
    user's email and then verify it. But this will add extra cost to the project.
    - Another way is to use a library like nodemailer to send email and then verify it. 
### Q.  At this point I don't know how to redirect to a specific page when some element is clicked so have to figure that out.
